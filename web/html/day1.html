Sapphire
I watch my luck turn round
A high flyer
I threw my bones around
Sure fire
I watch the current run
Live wire
Clear blue
Too true
Clear blue
Too true.

I don't know what to do
I got no place to go
Oh the day I lost my sweet Sapphire
My precious gems are dust
There's nothing left to trust
Oh the days I'll miss sweet Sapphire.

I saw her running round
Sweet liar.
And I ran the garden path
Sweet briar
I did just what I could
So tired
I threw my keys away
With no desire
Clear blue
Too true.

I don't know what to do
I got no place to go
Oh the days I miss sweet Sapphire
My precious gems are dust
There's nothing left to trust
Oh the days I'll miss sweet Sapphire.

I got no place to go
I don't know what to do
Ooh, the dream about Sapphire
I don't know what to do
I got nowhere to go
I got no face to show without Sapphire.

My precious gems are dust
There's nothing left to trust
Oh since the day I lost my sweet Sapphire
There's nothing I can trust
My precious gems are dust
Oh, the day I lost sweet Sapphire.

I don't know what to do
I don't know where to go
Oh the day I lost my sweet Sapphire</pre>
